# Course Questions - Lecture 9
**Chapter 1**
* Why would a company choose for Windows Servers?
The Answer
* Give a difference between a Windows client OS and a Server OS.
Purpose: A Windows client OS is designed to be used on personal computers and other devices, while a Windows server OS is designed to be used on servers that provide services to other devices on a network.
Features: A Windows client OS typically includes a range of features and applications that are intended for personal use, such as a web browser, email client, and media player. A Windows server OS includes a more robust set of features and applications that are designed for use in a business or enterprise environment, such as support for multiple users and the ability to run specialized server applications.
Scalability: A Windows client OS is generally designed to be used on a single device, while a Windows server OS is designed to be used on multiple devices and can support a larger number of users and workloads.
License: A Windows client OS is typically licensed for use on a single device, while a Windows server OS is typically licensed for use on multiple devices.
* What is the difference between LTSC and SAC?
LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) and SAC (Semi-Annual Channel) are two different update channels that are available for Windows 10, Microsoft's operating system. The main difference between the two is the frequency and nature of updates that they receive:
LTSC: This update channel is designed for use on devices that require long-term stability and do not need the latest features. It receives updates every 2-3 years, which include security and quality updates, but do not include new features or functionalities.
SAC: This update channel is designed for use on devices that need the latest features and functionalities, and are willing to accept a higher level of change. It receives updates twice a year, which include new features and functionalities, as well as security and quality updates.
* What different editions and installation options can you install when it comes to a Windows server?
Editions:
- Windows Server Standard: This edition is designed for small and mid-sized businesses, and includes support for file and print services, remote access, and other essential network infrastructure roles.
- Windows Server Datacenter: This edition is designed for enterprise-level environments and includes support for virtualization, storage, and other advanced features.
- Windows Server Essentials: This edition is designed for small businesses and includes support for file and print services, remote access, and other essential network infrastructure roles.
- Windows Server IoT: This edition is designed for use on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and includes support for device management, security, and connectivity.
Installation options:
F- ull installation: This option installs all of the features and components of the selected edition of Windows Server. It requires a significant amount of disk space and is generally used on servers that will be dedicated to running Windows Server.
- Server Core installation: This option installs a minimal version of Windows Server that includes only the core operating system and a limited set of features and components. It requires less disk space and is generally used on servers that will be dedicated to running specific roles or applications.
- Nano Server installation: This option installs a minimal version of Windows Server that includes only the core operating system and a very limited set of features and components. It requires the least amount of disk space and is generally used on servers that will be dedicated to running specific roles or applications.
* What is the difference between a retail, an OEM and a volume 
Retail, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), and volume licenses are three different types of licenses that are available for software products, including operating systems like Windows. The main difference between these license types is the way in which they are sold and distributed:
- Retail: A retail license is a full-price license that is sold to an end user through a retail outlet or online store. It includes a physical or digital copy of the software and a license key that is required to activate the software. Retail licenses are generally more expensive than other types of licenses.
- OEM: An OEM license is a discounted license that is sold to a manufacturer or assembler of computers or other hardware devices. It is intended to be installed and activated on the hardware device at the time of manufacture, and is not intended to be transferred to another device. OEM licenses are generally less expensive than retail licenses.
- Volume: A volume license is a discounted license that is sold to an organization in a large quantity, typically at least five licenses. It allows the organization to install the software on multiple devices and includes a volume license key that is used to activate the software. Volume licenses are generally less expensive than retail licenses.

What is the Win32 API? 
The Win32 API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions and data structures that allows developers to create Windows applications. It provides a standard way for developers to create applications that can run on any version of Windows, and is designed to be easy to use and flexible enough to support a wide range of applications.
The Win32 API includes functions for creating and managing windows, handling input and output, working with the file system, and performing other tasks that are common to Windows applications. It also includes data structures that define the layout and content of windows, dialog boxes, and other user interface elements.
The Win32 API is written in the C programming language, but it can be used with other languages, such as C++, Visual Basic, and .NET, through the use of language-specific wrappers or bindings.
* What is the WinRM?
WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is a Microsoft technology that allows administrators to remotely manage Windows servers and clients from a remote computer. It is based on the WS-Management protocol, which is a standard protocol for management of devices and systems over a network.
WinRM allows administrators to remotely execute commands, view and modify system configuration, and perform other management tasks on Windows servers and clients. It can be used in conjunction with other management tools, such as Microsoft System Center and PowerShell, to automate and streamline management tasks.
WinRM is enabled by default on Windows Server operating systems, but it must be manually enabled on Windows client operating systems. It is also available as a download for other operating systems, such as Linux and Unix.
* Give 5 examples what a company typically uses a Windows server for.
1. File and print services: A Windows Server can be used to host shared folders and printers, allowing users to access and print files from multiple devices on the network.
2. Remote access: A Windows Server can be configured to provide remote access to the network, allowing users to connect from off-site locations using a VPN (virtual private network) connection.
3. Email and collaboration: A Windows Server can be used to host an email server, such as Microsoft Exchange, and provide features like calendar, contacts, and task management for users.
4. Database management: A Windows Server can be used to host a database server, such as Microsoft SQL Server, and manage and store large amounts of data for use by applications and users.
5. Virtualization: A Windows Server can be used to host a virtualization platform, such as Hyper-V, and run multiple virtual machines on a single physical server, allowing for more efficient use of resources and easier management of multiple environments.
* What is AD?
AD (Active Directory) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that is used to store and manage information about a network of computers and other devices. It is primarily used to store information about users, groups, computers, and other network resources, and provides a central location for managing and organizing these resources.
AD is based on a hierarchical structure, with a single root domain at the top and multiple child domains branching off from it. It uses a database to store and organize information about the resources on the network, and provides a set of tools and APIs for managing and accessing this information.
AD is commonly used in enterprise environments to manage and secure access to network resources, and to provide single sign-on (SSO) access to applications and services. It is also used to manage and enforce policies, such as password complexity and expiration, and to provide centralized authentication and authorization services.
* What is an OU?
An OU (Organizational Unit) is a container within an Active Directory (AD) domain that is used to organize and manage objects, such as users, groups, and computers. OUs are used to group objects that have similar characteristics or that need to be managed in a similar way, and can be nested within other OUs to create a hierarchical structure.
For example, an organization might create an OU for each department in the company, and then create OUs within each departmental OU for each group or team within the department. This allows the organization to easily manage the objects within each department and group, and to apply policies and settings at the appropriate level of the hierarchy.
OUs are created and managed within the AD domain, and can be used to delegate administrative control over the objects within them to specific users or groups. This allows administrators to distribute management responsibilities and reduce the workload on the central IT department.
* What is a DC?
A DC (Domain Controller) is a server that is used to manage and maintain an Active Directory (AD) domain. It is responsible for authenticating users and devices that are accessing the domain, and for storing and replicating the directory data that is used to manage the domain.
A DC contains a copy of the AD database, which contains information about the objects that are within the domain, such as users, groups, computers, and other resources. It also contains a set of services and processes that are used to manage the domain, including the AD Domain Service (AD DS), the AD Lightweight Directory Service (AD LDS), and the Kerberos authentication service.
In a domain, there can be multiple DCs, which work together to provide fault tolerance and load balancing. If one DC goes offline, the other DCs can continue to provide authentication and directory services to the users and devices within the domain.
* What is a RODC?
A RODC (Read-Only Domain Controller) is a type of Domain Controller (DC) in an Active Directory (AD) domain that maintains a read-only copy of the AD database. It is used to provide authentication and directory services to users and devices in remote or branch locations, where it may not be feasible or desirable to deploy a full-featured DC.
A RODC allows users and devices in remote locations to authenticate and access resources on the network, but does not allow them to make changes to the AD database. It also does not replicate changes made to the AD database on other DCs back to the RODC, which helps to reduce the risk of sensitive data being compromised in the event that the RODC is lost or stolen.
A RODC is typically deployed in a branch office or other remote location, and is connected to a full-featured DC in the central location over a WAN (Wide Area Network) link. It is typically configured to authenticate only a specific set of users and devices, and to use caching to reduce the amount of traffic that is sent over the WAN link.
* What are the different options to logon to a Windows machine (authenticate) when domain-joined?
Domain user account: This option allows you to logon using a domain user account that has been created and managed by the domain administrator. You will need to provide your user name and password to authenticate.
Local user account: This option allows you to logon using a local user account that has been created on the machine itself, rather than in the domain. You will need to provide your user name and password to authenticate.
Network logon: This option allows you to logon using a domain user account, but you do not need to be physically present at the machine. Instead, you can logon remotely over the network using a remote desktop connection or other remote access tool.
Smart card logon: This option allows you to logon using a smart card, which is a type of physical token that contains your user name and password. You will need to insert the smart card into a reader on the machine and enter your PIN to authenticate.
Biometric logon: This option allows you to logon using a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition, instead of a user name and password. You will need to provide your biometric identifier to authenticate.
* What is typically stored in an X.509 certificate (the most important things)?
An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate that is used to verify the identity of an entity and to secure communications over a network. It typically contains the following information:
Subject: This is the identity of the entity that the certificate is issued to. It is typically the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of a server, but it can also be an individual user or an organization.
Issuer: This is the identity of the entity that issued the certificate. It is typically a certificate authority (CA), which is a trusted third party that issues and verifies certificates.
Public key: This is the public key of the entity that the certificate is issued to. It is used to encrypt and decrypt data that is transmitted over the network.
Validity period: This is the period of time during which the certificate is valid and can be used to secure communications. It is typically specified as a start date and an end date.
Signature: This is a digital signature that is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the certificate. It is created using the private key of the issuer and is verified using the issuer's public key.
* What is a SID, a GUID and NTLM?
SID (Security Identifier): A SID is a unique identifier that is assigned to each user, group, and other security principal in an Active Directory (AD) domain. It is used to identify and manage access to resources on the network, such as files and folders, and to enforce security policies.
GUID (Globally Unique Identifier): A GUID is a unique identifier that is used to identify resources, such as objects and devices, within a computer system or network. It is typically represented as a string of hexadecimal digits, and is used to uniquely identify resources that may have multiple instances or copies.
NTLM (NT LAN Manager): NTLM is a proprietary authentication protocol that is used to securely authenticate users and devices on a network. It is based on the challenge-response model, in which the client and server exchange a series of messages to verify the identity of the user or device. NTLM is commonly used in Windows environments to provide single sign-on (SSO) access to resources.
* What is more secure, a LM hash or an NT(LM) hash?
An NT hash (also known as an NT LAN Manager hash or NTLM hash) is generally considered to be more secure than a LM hash (LAN Manager hash). This is because the NT hash uses a stronger hashing algorithm and is less susceptible to certain types of attacks.
A LM hash is a legacy hashing algorithm that was used in early versions of Windows to store user passwords. It is based on the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm, which has been proven to be relatively weak and is vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as dictionary and rainbow table attacks.
In contrast, an NT hash uses a stronger hashing algorithm called MD4 (Message Digest 4), which is more resistant to attacks. It is also more flexible and can handle passwords of any length, whereas the LM hash is limited to passwords of 14 characters or less.
* What is LDAP and why is this interesting for developers?
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol that is used to access and manage directory services, such as Active Directory (AD). It is based on the X.500 standard and is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it well-suited for use over the network.
LDAP is interesting for developers because it provides a standard way to access and manage directory services from a wide range of applications and programming languages. It allows developers to build applications that can authenticate users, access directory information, and perform other tasks that are commonly required in enterprise environments.
* What different domain groups exist?
Security groups: Security groups are used to manage access to resources and enforce security policies. They can be used to grant or deny access to resources, such as files and folders, and to enforce policies, such as password complexity and expiration.
Distribution groups: Distribution groups are used to send emails to a group of users or other recipients. They do not have any permissions or access to resources, and are typically used for communication and collaboration.
Query-based distribution groups: Query-based distribution groups are similar to distribution groups, but they are populated dynamically based on a query that is defined by the administrator. This allows the group to include users or recipients that meet certain criteria, such as being members of a particular department or having a specific job title.
Universal groups: Universal groups are used to manage access to resources in a multi-domain forest. They can include users and groups from any domain in the forest, and can be granted permissions and access to resources in any domain.
Domain local groups: Domain local groups are used to manage access to resources within a single domain. They can include users and groups from any domain in the forest, but can only be granted permissions and access to resources within the domain in which they are created.
* How do NTFS and Share permissions interact with each other?
NTFS (NT File System) permissions and share permissions are two separate sets of permissions that are used to control access to resources on a Windows system. They interact with each other in the following way:
NTFS permissions are applied to resources that are stored on an NTFS-formatted volume, such as files and folders. They are used to control access to the resources at the local level, and take precedence over share permissions.
Share permissions are applied to resources that are shared over the network, such as files and folders that are shared using the "Sharing" feature in Windows. They are used to control access to the resources over the network, and are applied in addition to the NTFS permissions.
When a user attempts to access a shared resource, the system checks both the NTFS permissions and the share permissions to determine whether the user has the appropriate access. If the user has the necessary permissions according to both sets of permissions, then access is granted. If the user does not have the necessary permissions according to either set of permissions, then access is denied.
